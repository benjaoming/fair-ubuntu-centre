Cloning hard drives
===================

In order to obtain a data drive for the server, clone a **master** (or **source**) hard drive onto a **target**. There is nothing special about the master, just that it's a hard drive that you keep safe such that other hard drives can be cloned from it.

.. tip:: Keep your hard drives labeled with a version (or date). Confusion can be quite costly timewise.

.. warning:: Never deploy your last master copy, it is recommendable to have 2 master copies.

As of 2018, the data footprint is roughly 550 GB.
